                        <h2>About the Department</h2>
                        <p>Chemical engineering traditionally deals with how a chemical plant operates, but today it covers a wide range of areas like biotechnology, catalysis, pollution control, renewable energy such as solar energy, drug delivery, process control and systems engineering, microelectronics, polymers, surfactants, systems and computational biology, reactor designing, heat and mass transfer and many more.</p>
                    <p>Chemical engineering is a broad-based and interdisciplinary field and provides opportunities in several industries - programming, biology, or even economics; a flexibility that is not easily available in other disciplines.</p>
                    <p>Chemical Engineering plays a major role in bioengineering and has several real applications â€“ artificial organs, mechanical body parts, curing diseases, etc. Nano engineering and materials science is yet another application of principles of Chemical Engineering.
